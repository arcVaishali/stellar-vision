**Relief Connect** was the first runner-up in Impact Hacks'23. It's a disaster relief and rescue aid platform designed to streamline and enhance disaster response efforts during floods. This web-based app consists of two main interfaces:

1. **User Portal:** Allows individuals to send alerts for rescue, food/water supplies, and power, and report missing/stranded persons without requiring a login. Requests and alerts are validated via GPS.

2. **Organization Portal:** Designed for organizations like NDRF (National Disaster Relief Force), NGOs, logistics companies, and more, to receive and respond to alerts.

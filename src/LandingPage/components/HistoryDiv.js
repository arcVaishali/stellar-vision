            Remembering the lack of resources during 2008's Hurricane Ike, I reached out to some famous friends, who used the power of social media to collect an abundance of donations, we then went to the communities of Beaumont, Orange and Port Arthur Texas and distributed donated relief items directly to families in need. It was then Unite Disaster Relief was born.
